The Playback page allows you to manage the currently playing track. At the top of the page is the Artist. Beneath that is the Track Title. beneath that the Album name, or "[no album]" if the Album is not tagged in the metadata.

Beneath the Track information is the Playback Source. Options are MPD, Spotify, Airplay and DLNA. Clicking the label will open a selector, allowing you to choose the playback source.

Beneath the Playback Source you will find 3 graphical components. The first is the Track Position meter. The meter represents visually the duration played and remaining.

In the center, if enabled, is an image of the album art. Below it is the "Share" button, which allows you to post details of the current track on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. The last button takes you to a page where you can learn how to support our efforts.

On the right are the Volume Controls. The main graphical control represents the position of the Volume knob, and the numerical value, from 0 to 100. There are 3 buttons beneath the Volume Control. The first turns the volume down by 1%. The center button toggles the Mute function. The last button turns the volume up by 1%.
